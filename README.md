# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This group project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict heart disease based on health-related attributes.
We applied data preprocessing, feature selection using PCA, and built a classification model to analyze patient data and predict risks.

# Technologies & Skills Used:
    Python (Jupyter Notebook)
    Data Preprocessing
    Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    Classification (Logistic Regression)
    Data Visualization (Matplotlib & Seaborn)
